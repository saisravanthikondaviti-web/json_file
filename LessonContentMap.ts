      {
        type: 'text',
        content: `React Native is an open-source mobile application framework developed by Facebook (now Meta). It enables developers to build real, production-ready mobile applications for both Android and iOS using JavaScript and the React library. Instead of building separate applications using Swift for iOS and Kotlin or Java for Android, React Native allows developers to use a single JavaScript codebase that renders native components on each platform.

Unlike traditional hybrid frameworks that render web views inside mobile apps, React Native uses actual native UI components. This means when you create a button in React Native, it renders a real native button component on both Android and iOS. This approach ensures better performance and a more platform-consistent user experience compared to web-based hybrid solutions.

React Native follows a component-based architecture, just like React for web development. Developers build reusable UI components and manage application state efficiently. The framework also bridges JavaScript code with native modules, allowing access to device APIs such as camera, GPS, notifications, storage, and more. This makes it powerful enough for enterprise-level applications.

Today, React Native is widely used by companies such as Facebook, Instagram, Shopify, and Tesla, proving its scalability and reliability in real-world applications.`

      },
      {
        type: 'text',
        content: `React Native offers several powerful features that make it a popular choice for cross-platform development. One of the most important features is "Write Once, Run Anywhere." While some platform-specific adjustments are sometimes necessary, a significant portion of the codebase can be shared across both Android and iOS applications. This dramatically reduces development time and maintenance effort.

Another major feature is native performance. React Native does not rely on WebView rendering. Instead, it communicates with native components through a bridge, ensuring smoother animations and better responsiveness compared to typical hybrid frameworks. With the introduction of the new architecture (Fabric and TurboModules), performance has improved even further.

Hot Reloading and Fast Refresh allow developers to see code changes instantly without rebuilding the entire application. This speeds up development cycles and improves productivity significantly. Developers can adjust UI components, fix bugs, or refine logic and immediately see the results.

React Native also benefits from a massive open-source ecosystem. Thousands of third-party libraries are available for navigation, state management, animations, payment gateways, and more. This reduces the need to build everything from scratch and accelerates application delivery.`

        content: 'Why Choose React Native?'
      },
      {
        type: 'text',
        content: `React Native is often chosen because it provides an excellent balance between development speed and performance. For startups and enterprises alike, building two separate native applications can be costly and time-consuming. React Native reduces this overhead by enabling a shared codebase, which decreases both development and long-term maintenance costs.

Another advantage is developer availability. Since React Native uses JavaScript and React, web developers can transition into mobile development without learning entirely new programming languages. This lowers the learning curve and expands hiring possibilities.

The framework also supports modular development, making it easier to scale applications over time. Teams can work on independent features without interfering with the entire application structure. This makes it suitable for growing products.

Furthermore, React Native allows integration with existing native apps. If a company already has a native application, React Native components can be gradually introduced without rewriting the entire project. This flexibility makes it a strategic choice for long-term mobile development.`

      {
        type: 'subtitle',
        content: 'Architecture and Working Principle'
      },
      {
        type: 'text',
        content: `React Native works using a bridge-based architecture that connects JavaScript code with native platform APIs. When a developer writes JavaScript code, it runs inside a JavaScript engine such as Hermes or JavaScriptCore. The framework then translates UI components into native components using a bridge mechanism.

This bridge enables asynchronous communication between the JavaScript thread and the native thread. When UI updates are required, the JavaScript thread calculates changes using React’s reconciliation algorithm and sends instructions to native components. This ensures efficient rendering and smooth user interactions.

The newer React Native architecture introduces Fabric and TurboModules to reduce bridge bottlenecks. Fabric improves rendering performance by using synchronous communication when needed, while TurboModules optimize native module loading.

Understanding this architecture is crucial for optimizing performance. Developers must avoid unnecessary re-renders, optimize state updates, and use memoization techniques such as React.memo and useCallback to ensure efficient application behavior.`

      },
      {
        type: 'text',
        content: `React Native offers numerous advantages, including faster development cycles, shared codebase, strong community support, and near-native performance. It is particularly useful for MVP development and cross-platform products that need to reach market quickly.

However, it is not without limitations. Performance-heavy applications such as advanced gaming or highly graphics-intensive applications may still require fully native development. Additionally, when new device APIs are released, React Native may not immediately support them, requiring custom native module development.

Debugging can sometimes be more complex compared to pure native applications because issues may arise in the JavaScript layer, native layer, or bridge communication. Proper architecture planning and code organization are essential to minimize such issues.

Despite these limitations, for most business applications such as e-commerce, social media, productivity apps, and dashboards, React Native provides an excellent trade-off between performance and efficiency.`

Virtualization enables multiple workloads to run on shared hardware, maximizing utilization and reducing waste. Cloud platforms provide elasticity, meaning resources automatically scale up during peak demand and scale down during low usage. Global infrastructure ensures low latency and redundancy through distributed data centers. By abstracting hardware complexity, cloud computing allows teams to focus on application development and innovation rather than infrastructure maintenance.`

        content: `Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has grown to become one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability through significant whitespace and a clean syntax that allows developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than languages like Java or C++.

Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. This versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from web development and data science to artificial intelligence and automation. The language's extensive standard library, often described as "batteries included," provides modules and functions for virtually any task, from file I/O to web services.

One of Python's greatest strengths is its gentle learning curve, making it an ideal first programming language for beginners. Yet its depth and power satisfy the needs of experienced developers working on complex systems. Major companies like Google, Netflix, and NASA use Python extensively in their technology stacks.`

Second, Python boasts an incredibly rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. For web development, frameworks like Django and Flask enable rapid application development. In data science and machine learning, libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, and PyTorch have made Python the de facto standard. For automation and scripting, Python's simplicity shines through.

Third, Python has a massive, active community. This means abundant learning resources, extensive documentation, and quick solutions to common problems through platforms like Stack Overflow. The community's contributions to open-source libraries ensure Python stays relevant and powerful.

Finally, Python skills are in high demand. According to various job market analyses, Python consistently ranks among the top programming languages employers seek, with competitive salaries across industries.`

You can download the latest version from python.org. During installation on Windows, ensure you check "Add Python to PATH" to run Python from the command line.

After installation, verify Python is correctly installed by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing: python --version. You should see the installed version number. You'll also want to install pip, Python's package manager, which usually comes bundled with Python. Pip allows you to install third-party libraries with simple commands.

For writing code, you have several options. You can use a simple text editor like VS Code, Sublime Text, or Atom with Python extensions. For beginners, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm Community Edition or Thonny provides helpful features like code completion and debugging. Jupyter Notebook is excellent for data science and interactive learning.

Alternatively, you can start coding immediately using online platforms like Replit, Google Colab, or Python.org's online console. These require no installation and are perfect for quick experiments and learning.`

Notice how Python doesn't require semicolons at the end of statements or curly braces to define code blocks. Instead, it uses indentation to define structure. This enforced readability is a core feature of Python.

The input() function allows programs to interact with users. When called, it pauses program execution, waits for user input, and returns whatever the user typed as a string. You can then store this in variables and use it throughout your program.`

Python supports several built-in data types. Numbers include integers (whole numbers), floats (decimal numbers), and complex numbers. Strings represent text and are enclosed in quotes. Booleans represent True or False values. Lists, tuples, and dictionaries are collection types that hold multiple values.

Variable naming follows conventions: names should be descriptive, use lowercase with underscores between words (snake_case), and cannot start with numbers or use Python keywords. Good variable names make code self-documenting and easier to understand.`

Comparison operators like ==, !=, <, >, <=, and >= are used to create conditions. Logical operators (and, or, not) combine multiple conditions. Understanding operator precedence is important for writing correct conditions.`

Loop control statements like break, continue, and else provide additional control over loop execution. Break exits the loop entirely, continue skips to the next iteration, and else executes only if the loop completes normally (without break).

Understanding loops is crucial for processing collections, implementing algorithms, and handling repetitive tasks efficiently. Python's for loop is particularly powerful due to its ability to iterate directly over items without needing index variables.`

Tuples are immutable (cannot be changed) and are defined with parentheses. Both can contain mixed data types, though in practice homogeneous collections are more common.

Lists are the workhorse of Python collections. They support operations like appending, inserting, removing, and sorting. Their mutability makes them ideal for dynamic collections that change size and content during program execution.

Tuples, being immutable, are more memory-efficient and can be used as dictionary keys (lists cannot). They're perfect for fixed collections like coordinates, RGB values, or data records that shouldn't change. Understanding when to use each is key to writing efficient Python code.`

Sets store unique elements and excel at mathematical operations like union, intersection, and difference. Both are unordered collections (though Python 3.7+ preserves dictionary insertion order).

Dictionaries are everywhere in Python. They're used for mapping relationships, storing structured data, counting frequencies, and as a foundation for JSON-like data structures. Their average O(1) lookup time makes them incredibly efficient for many algorithms.

Sets are perfect for removing duplicates from collections, testing membership, and performing set operations. They're also O(1) for membership testing, making them much faster than lists for checking if an item exists in a collection.`

They're fundamental to organizing code, avoiding repetition, and implementing the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

Python supports various function types: regular functions, lambda functions, generator functions, and recursive functions. Functions can have default arguments, keyword arguments, variable-length arguments, and can return multiple values using tuples.

Understanding scope is crucial when working with functions. Python has LEGB rule: Local, Enclosing, Global, and Built-in scopes. Variables defined in different scopes have different visibility and lifetimes, affecting how they can be accessed and modified.`

Python provides a comprehensive exception handling system using try, except, else, and finally blocks. Exceptions are objects that represent errors or exceptional conditions that disrupt normal program flow.

When an error occurs, Python raises an exception. If not handled, the program terminates. By handling exceptions, you can provide fallback behaviors, log errors, or clean up resources. Python's exception hierarchy allows catching specific exception types or general ones.

Good exception handling distinguishes between recoverable errors and fatal ones. It ensures resources are properly released, provides meaningful error messages to users, and helps with debugging by preserving stack traces. Understanding common exception types and when to raise custom exceptions is key to writing professional Python code.`

It was originally developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation. Java was created with the vision of portability, reliability, and security in mind. One of its core philosophies is "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA), which means that Java code compiled into bytecode can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This platform independence made Java extremely popular for cross-platform development. Over the years, Java has evolved into a powerful ecosystem used for building web applications, enterprise software, scientific applications, financial systems, and Android mobile applications. Its simple syntax, strong community support, and structured programming approach make it suitable for both beginners and professional developers.'

It also includes built-in security features that protect against common vulnerabilities.\n• Multithreaded – Java allows multiple threads to execute concurrently, improving performance for applications that require multitasking.\n• Rich Standard Library – Java offers extensive APIs for data structures, networking, file handling, database connectivity (JDBC), and graphical user interfaces.\n• High Performance – With Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and runtime optimizations, Java delivers strong performance for large-scale systems.'

Each statement in Java typically ends with a semicolon, and code blocks are enclosed within curly braces {}. By learning the fundamental syntax rules, beginners can avoid common errors and build a strong programming foundation.`

Example:

class Student {
    String name;
    int age;

    void display() {
        System.out.println(name + " is " + age + " years old.");
    }

        s1.name = "John";
        s1.age = 20;
        s1.display();
    }
}

• Inheritance – Allows one class to acquire properties and methods of another class using the 'extends' keyword.

class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");

• Polymorphism – Means "many forms". It allows methods to behave differently based on the object.

class Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }

• Encapsulation – Wrapping data and methods into a single unit and restricting direct access using private variables.

class Person {
    private String name;

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

• Abstraction – Hiding implementation details and showing only essential features. Achieved using abstract classes or interfaces.

abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw();
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Circle");

fruits.add("Banana");
fruits.add("Apple"); // duplicates allowed

• LinkedList – Implements List and allows fast insertions/deletions. Can be used as a list or a queue.
Example:
import java.util.LinkedList;

LinkedList<Integer> numbers = new LinkedList<>();
numbers.add(10);
numbers.add(20);
numbers.addFirst(5); // add at the beginning
System.out.println(numbers);

• HashMap – Stores key-value pairs. Keys are unique; values can be duplicated. Fast lookup.
Example:
import java.util.HashMap;

HashMap<String, Integer> ages = new HashMap<>();
ages.put("Alice", 25);
ages.put("Bob", 30);

• HashSet – Stores unique elements, no duplicates, no guaranteed order.
Example:
import java.util.HashSet;

HashSet<String> colors = new HashSet<>();
colors.add("Red");
colors.add("Blue");
colors.add("Red"); // duplicate ignored

• TreeSet – Stores unique elements in sorted order.
Example:
import java.util.TreeSet;

TreeSet<Integer> scores = new TreeSet<>();
scores.add(50);
scores.add(30);
scores.add(40);
System.out.println(scores); // [30, 40, 50]`

By creating an index on one or more columns, the database can quickly locate rows without scanning the entire table. Indexes are particularly useful for large tables and columns frequently used in WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY, or GROUP BY clauses. However, too many indexes can slow down INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations, so it is important to use them strategically.

Example – Create an index on the 'name' column of Students table:

CREATE INDEX idx_name ON Students(name);

Example – Create a composite index on 'category_id' and 'price' in Products table:

CREATE INDEX idx_category_price ON Products(category_id, price);

Using subqueries and indexes together allows you to write efficient, complex SQL queries that return results quickly, even for large datasets. Mastery of these advanced concepts is essential for database optimization, analytics, and high-performance application development.`

• First Normal Form (1NF) – Ensures that each column contains atomic values (no repeating groups) and each row is unique.
Example: A table storing multiple phone numbers in one column violates 1NF. Instead, create separate rows for each phone number.

• Second Normal Form (2NF) – Achieved when the table is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key.
Example: In a table with StudentID, CourseID, StudentName, storing StudentName with every CourseID duplicates data. Separate into Student and Enrollment tables.

• Third Normal Form (3NF) – Achieved when the table is in 2NF and no non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute.
Example: If storing StudentCity along with StudentZip, and Zip determines City, then City should be moved to a separate table.

• Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) – A stricter version of 3NF, ensuring that every determinant is a candidate key. Helps handle certain edge cases where 3NF does not remove all redundancy.`

UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;
-- If any statement fails, rollback to maintain integrity
COMMIT;

• Consistency – Guarantees that a transaction transforms the database from one valid state to another, maintaining all predefined rules, constraints, and triggers.

• Isolation – Ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. Changes made by one transaction are not visible to others until committed.

• Durability – Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent, even in case of system crashes or failures.`

- Locking – Prevents other transactions from modifying data until the current transaction is complete.
Example: 
SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE id = 1 FOR UPDATE;

- Isolation Levels – SQL provides different isolation levels (READ UNCOMMITTED, READ COMMITTED, REPEATABLE READ, SERIALIZABLE) to control how transactions interact.

- Optimistic Concurrency – Assumes minimal conflicts and checks for data changes before committing.

Using transactions and concurrency control together ensures that your database remains accurate, reliable, and consistent, even under high load or multiple simultaneous users. This is critical for banking systems, e-commerce applications, and any environment where data integrity is essential.`

SELECT * FROM Students WHERE age > 18 AND grade = 'A';
-- Efficient:
SELECT name, age FROM Students WHERE age > 18 AND grade = 'A';

• Analyzing Execution Plans – Execution plans show how the database executes a query. By reviewing them, you can identify full table scans, missing indexes, or inefficient joins and adjust the query accordingly.

• Avoiding redundant calculations – Precompute values or use derived columns when possible, rather than recalculating in every query.

• Incremental Backup – Captures only the changes made since the last backup (full or incremental). Saves storage and speeds up backup time but requires the previous backup chain for recovery.  
Example:
-- MySQL incremental backup can be done using binary logs.

• Differential Backup – Captures changes made since the last full backup. It is a middle ground between full and incremental backups in terms of storage and recovery time.

Example:
-- SQL Server:
RESTORE DATABASE School FROM DISK = 'school_full.bak' WITH STOPAT = '2026-02-17 12:00:00';

• Restore from Backups – Combines full, incremental, or differential backups to restore the database fully. Requires careful sequencing to ensure consistency.  
Example:
-- Restore full backup first, then apply incremental or differential backups as needed.

By implementing regular backup schedules and testing recovery procedures, organizations can ensure business continuity, maintain data integrity, and reduce the impact of unforeseen disasters on their SQL databases.`

Unlike traditional relational databases that rely on tables and fixed schemas, NoSQL databases can store unstructured or semi-structured data, making them ideal for modern web applications, big data, and real-time analytics. They are designed to scale horizontally across multiple servers, allowing for better performance in distributed environments.`

• Document Databases – Store data as JSON or BSON documents, allowing nested structures. Examples include MongoDB and CouchDB.  
Example:
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 25,
  "courses": ["Math", "Physics"]
}

• Key-Value Databases – Store data as a key-value pair, ideal for caching and fast lookups. Examples include Redis and DynamoDB.  
Example:
"user:1001" => "{'name': 'Bob', 'age': 30}"

• Column-Family Databases – Organize data into columns instead of rows for high-performance analytics. Examples include Apache Cassandra and HBase.  
Example:
RowKey: 101, Columns: {Name: 'Alice', Age: 25, Score: 90}

• Graph Databases – Store data as nodes and edges to represent relationships. Examples include Neo4j and Amazon Neptune.  
Example: Node: Person(Alice), Node: Person(Bob), Edge: FRIENDS_WITH(Alice → Bob)`

- Big Data Applications – Handle massive volumes of structured and unstructured data efficiently.  
- Real-time Web Apps – Support fast reads and writes for applications like social media feeds, messaging, and gaming.  
- Content Management Systems – Flexible schemas allow storage of varied content types without redesigning the database.

By understanding NoSQL types and their use cases, developers can choose the appropriate database system to handle modern data requirements, providing flexibility, scalability, and performance for complex applications.`
